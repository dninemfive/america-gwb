# dninemfive's America (George W. Bush)
Adds the above country as a civilization in Sid Meier's Civilization V.

UA (Shock and Awe): Ranged attacks deal damage to adjacent enemy Units and Cities. During Golden Ages, mounted and mechanized land units generate Gold with kills and lower adjacent enemies' Combat Strength.

UU: Bradley (Mechanized Infantry): While in friendly territory, generates one TOW Missile per turn (max 2). Passively constructs Courthouses in garrisoned cities and defensive Buildings while adjacent to friendly City-States. Counts as a Mechanized Unit for the purposes of the UA. 11% more expensive (415 vs 375).
    TOW Missile: Ranged unit which is destroyed upon attacking. 35 CS/3 Range. +100% vs Mechanized units.

UU: Nimitz-Class (Carrier): Unlocked later, at Robotics. 55 CS (vs 40). Requires Uranium instead of Oil. Double movement in Ocean. Embarked land Units share its movement and may paradrop when stacked. Can hold 4 planes (vs 2).
